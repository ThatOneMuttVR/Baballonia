You may be prompted to download the .NET runtime for desktop apps, install it if need be.

### MacOS

## Platform Compatibility

To get started, follow the [quickstart guide on our documentation page](https://docs.babble.diy/docs/babbleofficaltracker).

### VRChat

#### VRCFaceTracking

To use Baballonia with VRChat, you will need to use VRCFaceTracking with the `VRCFT-Babble` module.

1. Download and install the latest version of VRCFaceTracking from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3329480/VRCFaceTracking/).
1. Install the `VRCFT-Babble` module within VRCFaceTracking.
1. Use Baballonia to set the module mode (eyes, face or both). Restart VRCFaceTracking to see your changes.

More information can be found on the [VRCFT Docs](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/vrcft-software/vrcft\#module-registry)

#### VRC Native Eyelook

Alternatively, Baballonia also supports [VRC Native Eyelook](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-eye-tracking).

While this doesn't support lower face tracking, it supports (almost) all VRChat Avatars.

### Resonite 

Resonite works natively with Baballonia's eye and face tracking - no external tools necessary!

### ChilloutVR

ChilloutVR has a mod-based integration for Baballonia's eye and face tracking. Please refer to our docs (below) for installation.
